### Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging #3

## Issue Summary:

  * Duration: 5 days (start: 15/02/2024], end: [18/02/2024], time zone: [GMT+0300 (East Africa Time)])
  * Impact: The requirements of the assignment were not completed as requested, leading to a delay in the project timeline.
  * The rootcause of the project was created during debugging 0x17-web_stack_debugging_3

## Timeline:

  * Issue detected: [15/02/2024 - 15:00]
  * Issue detected by: BETELHEM ASSEFA
  * Actions taken: BETELHEM investigated the issue in the /alx-system_engineering-devops/0x17-web_stack_debugging_3 directory.I noticed the syntax error in the 0-  strace_is_your_friend.pp file.
  * Escalation: The issue was escalated to checker for assistance.
  * Resolution: The issue was resolved by correcting the syntax error in the 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp file.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

  * Root Cause: The error message "Error: Could not parse for environment production: Syntax error at 'onlyif' (file: /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x17-web_stack_debugging_3/0-strace_is_your_friend.pp, line: 6, column: 3) on node eliana" indicates a syntax error in the 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp file.
  * Resolution: The syntax error was identified and fixed by modifying the 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp file. The correct syntax was added to resolve the issue.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:

  * Improve code review process: Implement a thorough code review process to catch syntax errors and other issues before deployment.
  * Enforce coding standards: Ensure developers follow established coding standards, including proper formatting and syntax guidelines.
  * Enhanced testing: Increase the level of testing, including unit tests and integration tests, to catch errors and ensure the desired output is achieved.
  * Continuous Integration (CI): Implement a CI system to automatically build and test the code, providing early detection of syntax errors.
  * Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for the project, including debugging steps, known issues, and their resolutions.

## Tasks to Address the Issue:

1. Identify the syntax error in the 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp file. 
2. Correct the syntax error by modifying the 0-strace_is_your_friend.pp file.
3. Perform a local test to verify that the desired output is correctly displayed.
4. The checker Review the code changes made by me and provide feedback.
5. Make any necessary adjustments based on the feedback from the checker.
6. Document the debugging process, including the identified issue and the steps taken to resolve it.

## Lessons Learned:

  * Thoroughly review code before deployment: Syntax errors can cause significant delays and impact project timelines.
  * Collaborate and seek assistance: Developers should not hesitate to escalate issues and seek help from senior team members when necessary.
  * Test extensively: Increased testing efforts can help identify issues early on and prevent them from reaching production.
