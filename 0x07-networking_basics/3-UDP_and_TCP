## For the TCP box:

The correct statement is: 1. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a slow way but surely.
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable and connection-oriented protocol. It ensures that data is transferred in a reliable and orderly manner between sender and receiver. TCP introduces mechanisms for error detection, retransmission of lost packets, flow control, and congestion control. Although TCP may introduce some overhead and may not be as fast as UDP, it guarantees the delivery of data without loss or corruption.

## For the UDP box:

The correct statement is: 2. It is a protocol that is transferring data in a fast way and might lose data along in the process.
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless and unreliable protocol. It is designed for fast data transmission with minimal overhead. UDP does not provide mechanisms for error detection, retransmission, flow control, or congestion control. As a result, UDP can transmit data quickly but with the possibility of data loss or corruption. It is suitable for applications where speed and efficiency are prioritized over reliability, such as real-time streaming or online gaming.

## For the TCP worker:

The correct statement is: 1. Have you received boxes x, y, z?

The TCP worker, representing the reliable Transmission Control Protocol, would typically inquire about the receipt of specific data segments or packets. It would ask the receiver if it has successfully received the specific boxes (x, y, z) that were sent. TCP ensures reliable delivery of data and uses acknowledgments to confirm the successful receipt of data segments.
