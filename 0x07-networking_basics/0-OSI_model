The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that describes the different layers involved in network communication. It was created by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in the 1980s as a way to standardize how different computer systems could communicate with each other.

The OSI model is not a physical specification that network hardware manufacturers must follow. Instead, it is a reference model that provides a common language for understanding how network communication works. The model is organized into seven layers, each with its own specific functions.

Here are the seven layers of the OSI model, from lowest to highest level:

1. Physical Layer: The physical layer is responsible for the transmission of raw data bits across a physical medium, such as a cable or a wireless signal.
2.Data Link Layer: The data link layer is responsible for packaging data into frames and transmitting them between network devices on the same network segment.
3.Network Layer: The network layer is responsible for routing data packets across different networks. It determines the best path for data to take to reach its destination.
4. Transport Layer: The transport layer is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between applications on different computers. It ensures that data is delivered in the correct order and without errors.
5.Session Layer: The session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions between communicating applications.
6. Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is responsible for formatting data so that it can be understood by the receiving application. This includes tasks such as encryption, decryption, and compression.
7. Application Layer: The application layer is the layer that provides network services to applications. This includes services such as file transfer, email, and web browsing.

The OSI model is a valuable tool for understanding how network communication works. It is still widely used today, even though the actual protocols used in network communication may differ from the OSI model.
